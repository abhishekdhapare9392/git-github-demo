    <h1>Git & GitHub</h1>
    <p>
      Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system that
      allows developers to efficiently manage and track changes made to their
      source code. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and is widely used
      in software development to collaborate on projects with other developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git allows developers to create branches of their code, allowing for
      different versions of the same code to be worked on simultaneously. It
      also allows for easy merging of different versions of code and keeps track
      of all changes made, making it easier to revert back to previous versions
      if necessary. Additionally, Git allows developers to work on their code
      locally without needing a constant internet connection, and then easily
      push their changes to a remote repository, such as GitHub or GitLab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, Git is an essential tool for any software developer looking to
      manage and track changes made to their code, collaborate with others, and
      keep their code organized.
    </p>

    <h1>What is GitHub?</h1>
    <p>
      GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git, a version control system, to
      facilitate collaboration and management of software development projects.
      It allows developers to store their code on a central repository, making
      it easier for them to collaborate with others and keep track of changes to
      their codebase.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub provides a variety of features for developers to work on their
      projects, such as issue tracking, project management tools, and code
      review tools. It also has a built-in social network for developers,
      allowing them to follow and interact with other developers and stay
      up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in software
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the key features of GitHub is the ability to fork repositories.
      Forking allows developers to create their own copy of an existing
      repository, make changes to it, and then submit those changes back to the
      original repository for review and inclusion. This enables collaboration
      between developers from all over the world and allows for the creation of
      open-source software projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub is used by millions of developers worldwide, from individual
      developers working on small projects to large teams working on complex
      software applications. It has become a critical tool for software
      development and has revolutionized the way developers work together and
      share their code.
