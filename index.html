    <h1>Git & GitHub</h1>
    <p>
      Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system that
      allows developers to efficiently manage and track changes made to their
      source code. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and is widely used
      in software development to collaborate on projects with other developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git allows developers to create branches of their code, allowing for
      different versions of the same code to be worked on simultaneously. It
      also allows for easy merging of different versions of code and keeps track
      of all changes made, making it easier to revert back to previous versions
      if necessary. Additionally, Git allows developers to work on their code
      locally without needing a constant internet connection, and then easily
      push their changes to a remote repository, such as GitHub or GitLab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, Git is an essential tool for any software developer looking to
      manage and track changes made to their code, collaborate with others, and
      keep their code organized.
